## To-Do List for QA Testing on WordPress

### 1. **Initial Setup**
- Ensure the testing environment is set up correctly (local/staging environment) using [Flywheel Local](https://localwp.com/) or similar.
- Verify that the test site has the same configurations as the production site.
- Install necessary WordPress themes, plugins, and custom code for testing.

### 2. **Functional Testing**

- Test the WordPress site on various devices to ensure responsiveness:
  - Mobile devices (iPhone, Android phones)
  - Tablets (iPad, Android tablets)
  - Desktop monitors with different resolutions
- Use tools like [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/) for emulation.

### 5. **Performance Testing**

  - [GTMetrix](https://gtmetrix.com/)
  - [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/)
  - [Pingdom](https://www.pingdom.com/)

### 8. **Usability Testing**
- Simulate real user behavior scenarios on the website.
- Perform form validation and test all input fields (contact forms, checkout forms, etc.).
- Check user registration and login processes.

### 9. **Regression Testing**
- Create automated tests for regression using [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) or [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).
- Verify that new updates or features do not break existing functionality.
- Re-test critical flows after bug fixes and feature enhancements.

### 10. **Backup & Recovery Testing**
- Test backup plugins like [UpdraftPlus](https://updraftplus.com/) or [BackupBuddy](https://ithemes.com/backupbuddy/).
- Perform database and full-site backups.
- Test the restoration process to ensure backups are working correctly.

### 11. **Database Testing**
