# Comprehensive WordPress QA Checklist for Plugins

## 1. **Initial Setup**
- Ensure a clean testing environment is set up using [Flywheel Local](https://localwp.com/) or a similar local environment.
- Install the plugin in a clean WordPress setup and ensure that all dependencies (other plugins, themes) are properly set up.
- Activate the plugin and ensure no initial errors in the WordPress dashboard or debug log.

## 2. **PHPCS (PHP Code Sniffer) & Code Standards**
- Install [PHP Code Sniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) and [WordPress Coding Standards](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards).
  ```bash
  composer require --dev wp-coding-standards/wpcs
  phpcs --config-set installed_paths vendor/wp-coding-standards/wpcs
  phpcs --standard=WordPress path/to/your/plugin
  ```
- Run PHPCS to check for any code violations or warnings.
- Address any code structure, naming conventions, or security issues flagged by PHPCS.

## 3. **Plugin Checker**
- Install the [Plugin Check](https://wordpress.org/plugins/plugin-check/) plugin to scan for:
  - Deprecated functions.
  - Missing plugin headers (name, description, version).
  - Hardcoded URLs and database queries.
  - Compatibility issues with WordPress core and third-party libraries.

## 4. **Functional Testing**
- **Activate/Deactivate Tests**:
  - Activate the plugin and check for proper functionality across all admin and frontend interfaces.
  - Deactivate and reactivate to ensure settings and data persist correctly.
  - Uninstall the plugin and verify whether all settings and data are removed cleanly.
- **Dependency Edge Cases**:
  - For WooCommerce addons: Disable WooCommerce and verify that the plugin gracefully deactivates or shows an appropriate message.
  - For BuddyPress addons: Disable BuddyPress to ensure the plugin does not cause errors and is properly disabled or shows an admin notice.
  - Test with and without dependencies to ensure the plugin responds properly.

## 5. **Core Features and Addon-Specific Feature List**
- Document and test core plugin features:
  - User flows.
  - Admin settings.
  - Frontend functionality.
  - Custom post types, taxonomies, and custom fields.
  - REST API or AJAX requests.
- Test addon-specific features separately:
  - Ensure that addon features do not break core plugin functionality.
  - Verify that disabling the addon does not leave behind broken features or errors.

## 6. **Action Hook and Filter Testing**
- Verify that all action hooks and filters are working as intended.
- Confirm that hooks are in the correct places (e.g., `wp_enqueue_scripts`, `admin_enqueue_scripts`, `init`).
- Test the flexibility of hooks for custom development (can developers add or remove functionality via hooks?).

## 7. **JavaScript and CSS Testing**
- **Enqueue Scripts and Styles**:
  - Check that JavaScript and CSS files are enqueued properly in the plugin.
  - Verify that scripts and styles are only loaded on the necessary pages.
  - Use developer tools to confirm that unnecessary scripts/styles are not loaded globally.
- **Minification**:
  - Ensure that JS/CSS files are minified in production mode.
  - Include source maps for development environments.

## 8. **Edge Case Testing**
- **Database Integrity**:
  - Check for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
  - Test how the plugin handles incomplete or corrupted data.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Test how the plugin handles unexpected input or missing data.
  - Simulate errors (e.g., disabling dependencies) and ensure the plugin handles them without breaking the site.
- **Form Validation**:
  - Ensure proper validation for all user input fields (numbers, emails, text).

## 9. **Security Testing**
- **Nonces and Escaping**:
  - Verify that nonces are used on forms and links to prevent CSRF attacks.
  - Ensure all data is properly escaped using `esc_html()`, `esc_attr()`, `esc_url()`, etc.
  - Test user permissions to ensure restricted actions are correctly enforced.
- **User Roles & Permissions**:
  - Verify that only users with the proper capabilities (admins, editors, etc.) can access plugin settings or execute plugin actions.

## 10. **Message Labels and Language Consistency**
- **Professional Language**:
  - Ensure all admin notices, settings, and error messages use consistent and professional language.
  - Check spelling and grammar.
- **Translation-Ready**:
  - Confirm that all strings are wrapped in localization functions (`__()`, `_e()`, etc.) for translation.
  - Verify that `.pot` files are generated for the plugin.
  - Test translations using a language-switching plugin.

## 11. **Regression Testing**
- Perform regression tests after every new feature or bug fix to ensure existing features are not broken.
- Use automated tools like [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) or [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for creating automated regression tests.

## 12. **Unused Functions and Code Cleanup**
- Check for unused functions and code that can be removed.
- Test whether deprecated functions are properly replaced and do not exist in the codebase.

## 13. **Testing for Performance Issues**
- **Database Queries**:
  - Test if any SQL queries are slowing down the site.
  - Ensure queries are optimized and not unnecessarily called on every page.
- **Caching**:
  - Verify that cacheable data is being stored using the WordPress caching API.
  - Test whether object caching improves performance when the plugin is active.

## 14. **Accessibility Testing**
- Verify that the plugin admin screens are accessible as per WCAG 2.1 standards.
- Use tools like [Axe DevTools](https://www.deque.com/axe/devtools/) and [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) to identify accessibility issues.
- Ensure proper keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.

## 15. **Unit Testing**
- Create PHPUnit tests for critical plugin features.
- Ensure that the plugin passes all unit tests before release.

## 16. **Backup & Recovery Testing**
- Test plugin compatibility with backup plugins like [UpdraftPlus](https://updraftplus.com/).
- Verify that plugin data is included in full-site backups.
- Test the restoration of plugin data from backups.

## 17. **SEO Testing (If Applicable)**
- Verify that plugin functionality does not break or hinder the siteâ€™s SEO.
- Use tools like [Yoast SEO](https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/) or [Rank Math](https://rankmath.com/) to check if plugin pages/posts are properly optimized for SEO.

## 18. **Documentation and Support**
- Ensure that the plugin includes proper documentation, both for end-users and developers.
- Verify that tooltips, inline help, or links to external documentation are clear and accessible.

## Tools Required for QA Testing
1. **PHPCS**: For coding standards and compliance.
2. **Plugin Checker**: To check for plugin compatibility and common issues.
3. **BrowserStack**: For cross-browser testing.
4. **Selenium/Cypress**: For regression and automation testing.
5. **GTMetrix/PageSpeed Insights**: For performance checks.
6. **Query Monitor/Debug Bar**: For debugging database queries and other performance metrics.
7. **Axe DevTools/WAVE**: For accessibility testing.
8. **UpdraftPlus/BackupBuddy**: For backup and recovery tests.
